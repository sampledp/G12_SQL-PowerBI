                                                               Google Sheets Theory
**1. Spreadsheet Basics, Variables, and Shortcuts**
Spreadsheet Fundamentals: Spreadsheets are grid-based applications that are used to organize, analyze, and store data. Each cell in a spreadsheet can contain text, numbers, or formulas.
Basic Operations: This includes entering data into cells, formatting cells to change the appearance of data, and performing simple calculations using formulas.
Variables: In the context of spreadsheets, variables are used to store values that can be referenced and manipulated in formulas. For example, you can assign a variable to a cell containing a number and then use that variable in calculations instead of the actual number.
Keyboard Shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts can help you work more efficiently by allowing you to perform common tasks quickly. For example, pressing Ctrl+C copies selected cells, and Ctrl+V pastes them.

**2. Introduction to Your First Functions**
Functions: Functions are predefined formulas that perform calculations or manipulate data in some way. For example, the SUM function adds up a range of numbers, and the AVERAGE function calculates the average of a range of numbers.
Basic Functions: In this section, you'll learn about some of the most commonly used basic functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, and MAX/MIN. These functions can help you perform simple calculations and analyze your data.

**3. Introduction to Conditional Functions**
Conditional Statements: Conditional functions allow you to perform different actions based on specified conditions. The most common conditional function is the IF statement, which allows you to test a condition and return one value if the condition is true, and another value if it's false.
Logical Functions: In addition to IF statements, there are other logical functions such as AND, OR, and NOT, which allow you to combine multiple conditions or perform logical operations on your data.

**4. Sorting, Filtering & Pivot Tables Crash Course**
Sorting: Sorting allows you to arrange your data in a specific order, such as alphabetically or numerically. This can help you identify patterns or trends in your data more easily.
Filtering: Filtering allows you to display only the data that meets certain criteria, hiding the rest. This can help you focus on specific subsets of your data for analysis.
Pivot Tables: Pivot tables are powerful tools for summarizing and analyzing large datasets. They allow you to create interactive tables that can be manipulated to display different summaries and views of your data.

**5. Lookups**
Lookup Functions: Lookup functions allow you to search for specific information within a dataset. For example, the VLOOKUP function searches for a value in the first column of a range and returns a value in the same row from a specified column.
HLOOKUP: HLOOKUP is similar to VLOOKUP but searches for the value in the first row of a range and returns a value in the same column from a specified row.

**6. GOOGLE Functions**
Advanced Functions: Google Sheets offers a range of advanced functions that are not available in other spreadsheet applications. These functions can help you perform complex calculations and manipulate your data in unique ways.
Features: Google Sheets also offers features such as collaboration tools, add-ons, and integrations with other Google services, which can help you work more efficiently and effectively.

**7. Import Range Data create an Excel format**
Importing Data: Importing data from external sources is a common task in spreadsheet applications. Google Sheets allows you to import data from sources such as CSV files, Excel files, and Google Drive.
Formatting Data: Formatting data effectively is important for readability and compatibility with other applications. In this section, you'll learn how to format imported data to ensure it displays correctly in Excel and other spreadsheet applications.
